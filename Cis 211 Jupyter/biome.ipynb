    "**Fish:** &nbsp; The way the simulation is defined a fish might be eaten before the top level simulation calls the `live` method.  Your `live` method should check to make sure the fish is still alive.  The easiest way to do this is to include an instance variable named `_alive` that is set to True when the fish is initialized and set to False when it dies.\n",

    "**Animal:** &nbsp; Keep this in mind when you design the class hierarchy: every object has an attribute named ``__class__`` (with two underscores before and after the name).  It is a reference to the class an object was defined with.  As an example of how to use it, consider what would happen if we want to define `reproduce` in the Animal class so it is inherited by both Fish and Bear classes.  We need to know the value of `breed_interval` in each object's own class.  We can find this value using the expression\n",
